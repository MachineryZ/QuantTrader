# Explanation
In this markdown file, we will restore some obscure and mis-understanding definitions:

1. level-1 data:
    - Level 1 Data is the basic quote data available to investors. It displays the national best bid and offer (NBBO) quote in real time, e.e. the highest bid and lowest ask price for an individual security. Users can also see other real time information such as volume, last price, and best bid/ask price. This is sufficient for most investors.
    - Bid price: the highest posted price where someone is willing to buy an asset
    - Bid size: The number of shares, forex lots, or contracts that people are trying to buy at the bid price
    - Ask price: The lowest posted price where someone is willing to sell an asset. Also called the "offer price"
    -  
2. level-2 data:
    - Level 2 data builds on level 1 data by also displaying market depth. Market depth means the market's ability to trade large orders without impacting of a security. Users with level 2 data will see the NBBO and also see the next best 30 bid/ask prices, as well as the size for each price level, all in real time. This gives the user a much more granular picture of the order book for security. Active or High-frequency traders will prefer level 2 data.
